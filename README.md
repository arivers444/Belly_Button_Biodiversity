# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of belly buttons.

The goals of the challenge are to:

  - Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
  
  - Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
  
  - Complete the demographic information panel.
